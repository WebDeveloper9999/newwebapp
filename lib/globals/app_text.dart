      '''Welcome! My name is Rushit Patel Bharatkumar, and I am a fervent lover of these three subjects, namely, finance, sports, and criminology.

My B.COM from The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda along with an MBA from University Canada West bring commerce and business awareness together very well, where people lack clarity between these two disciplines.

In the role of National Cricket Player as I do, I obviously champion the same team spirit and disciplineer, the same values that I bring to my career as well. I aim to become a candidate in CFA and work at the front of portfolio management.

Finance is not the only aspect of my dedication that I seek to learn. I take an interest in the criminal behavior and my intention is to improve the criminal justice system. Right now thesis in economics, PhD, I aim to the convergence of economics and criminology for societal impact.

Conversation with me on this program about banks, academia and activism will be brimming with emotions and goals.
